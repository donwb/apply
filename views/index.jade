p Want to work at Turner Broadcasting?  Want to jump to the front of the line? Then this is for you.

p Thanks for expressing interest in working at Turner Broadcasting.  The Enterprise Applications group is a progressive group of software developers who build all kinds of apps.   Small, large, desktop, mobile, web...

p 
    i We make it possible for Law and Order to air every night at 8:00pm.

p Explanation:

p  This is completely optional.  If you are interested in a developer or designer job at Turner, all you need to do is apply via turner.com/jobs.  If you are the kind of person who likes to code/design for fun then this is for you.
 

p Turner is a big place, and as such not every group uses this as a mechanism for candidate applications.  Check out the list below for qualifying positions:

if positions
    ul
    each p in positions
        - var t = p.title + ' ' + p.req + ' ' + p.url;
        li= t
else
    p Sorry, EA doesn't have any openings at this time.  Please check turner.com/jobs for positions in other area of Turner.
